For now I will be using Notepad++ on Windows because:

- I have already worked in this text editor before
- It is super simple
- I like the fact that it has auto finish options and it colours various different parts of my code.

I do not have enough experience with Sublime or Atom and can not use Brackets since I'm on Windows.
